NPCs:


Wizard – Wears a wizard hat. Funny man. Being a cube stripped him of his magic, though.
He has a quest for the player to find his wand that he dropped in the dragon cave.


Peasant – Wears a cloth hat. Makes sarcastic, snarky, fourth wall-breaking comments
that critique the concept of the game. Has a conspiracy that since the only
recognizable attribute is silly hats, someone could be in disguise and be up to no good.


Knight – Wears a knight helmet and holds a sword. Serious man. . . Or so it seems.


Smith – Has glasses and holds a hammer. Talks like a funny dwarf.
If the player can collect the correct materials for him, he can build an EPIC sword
that can actually hurt the dragon. The smith hates the Dovahkiid, as he believes that
he was really a false prophet and wants him dead. Likewise, he idolizes the Dovahkube
as the new savior. 


Thief – Seemingly a lonely cube. Asks the player to leave him alone.


Three-Headed Dragon – 3 dragons of legend fused together by an evil wizard.
They immediately kill the wizard for putting them together, and, since there is no
other wizard powerful enough to revert it, they are stuck together forever.
The 3 heads are all distinct, and hate each other. The main one used to be able to
morph people into whatever he wanted, but now, since their magic is split 3 ways,
he can only change people into a simple cube. He is the black head and thinks highly
of himself, is the self-proclaimed leader. The green head to the right hand side is
female and is more stoic than the other two, but still gets annoyed by her comrades.
The left hand side pink head is aggressive, always hungry for more humans, and is
always angry.


Dovahkiid – The true dragon slayer of legend. He got lost in the dragon cave when
trying to find the dragon. When the player finds him, the Dovahkiid will ask him
where to find the dragon. The player can tell him where the dragon is
(which will cause him to show up and join the Player in the boss fight), or choose
not to tell him. He is really nice as he is the true messiah, but since he got lost
on his way to the fight, the community thinks he’s a false prophet. Thus once the
player asks him for some blood, he will give it to him without question. But if you
kill him, you get the blood, too. 


Goblins – They were turned into cubes as well by the dragon. They are the mobs of the
area and show up in the forest and caves. They are green cubes. 





QUESTS:

MAIN QUEST:

Slay the Dragon: The dragon is located at the very end of the cave
outside of town. In order to defeat the dragon, all three heads
must be slain. Before initiating combat, the Dovahkube may speak
to the dragon and attempt to reason with it.



SIDE QUESTS:

Epic Sword: The Smith will forge the epic sword for the Dovahkube if
he brings him the three ingredients: Flowers on Fire, Magic,
and the Blood of the Dovahkiid. Without the epic sword, the player
may have an extremely difficult time in fighting the dragon.


Wizard's Wand: The Wizard asks the Dovahkube to find his wand that he lost
in the cave in which the dragon resides.

Dovahkiid: The player may seek the Dovahkiid's help in fighting the dragon.
